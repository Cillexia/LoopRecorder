# What is LoopRecorder?
* Simple code for creating amazing perfect animation loops, which appear to run endlessly.
* Lets you run and record an animation loop frame by frame.
* You can switch recording ON/OFF.
* Provides a calculated progress value.
* Code contains by default a DEMO animation.

# How To Use?
Create loop, test it, record it.
* Change SETTINGS to your liking.
* Set TOTAL_FRAMES to a value, which fits the needs of your animation.
* With NAME you can change the name of the output folder, as well as each frame's name. 
* In the function draw(float progress), put your animaton code.
* The loop starts with a progress value of 0.0 and ends with 1.0-frame. (Never reaches 1.0, since this is the beginning of the next cycle)
* When satisfied with the result, switch RECORD = true.
* The outputed images are your animation frame by frame. Now you can create a gif, mp4, mov, webm, or any other file type from the just generated images.

# Smooth loops with high resolution and fps?
If you want to play your loop in high resolution and with lots of fps, you may want to make a mp4 or mov.
On many platforms this will run automatically as a loop, repeating the video when it is over.
As mov this demo loop runs with 60fps.
