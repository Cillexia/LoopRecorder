* Lets you run and record an animation loop frame by frame.
* You can switch recording ON/OFF.
* Provides a calculated progress value.
* Code contains by default a DEMO animation.

# How To Use?
Create loop, test it, record it.
* Change SETTINGS to your liking.
* Set TOTAL_FRAMES to a value, which fits the needs of your animation.
* With NAME you can change the name of the output folder, as well as each frame's name. 
* In the function draw(float progress), put your animaton code.
* The loop starts with a progress value of 0.0 and ends with 1.0-frame. (Never reaches 1.0, since this is the beginning of the next cycle)
